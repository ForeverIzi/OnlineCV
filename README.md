# Online CV

This is my online CV, created as part of the **Casulo Tecnológico** project, where the goal is to develop something that solves a personal problem using only **HTML and CSS**.

In my case, the problem I decided to tackle is building my online resume, since I've been procrastinating on that for quite a while.

### Notes ‼️

- I'm committing from the point where the first section was already done, because i forgot to create the Git repository at the beginning of the project. I only remembered when i was about to start the second section with my professional experience.
- During the latest updates, I noticed a bug in the animation for the "EXPERIENCE" section in the NavBar. It wasn’t being properly selected after scrolling to its section. I discovered the issue was caused by the others sub-sections inside the mid-section, but I have no idea how to fix it. So, I commented out every sub-section, and apparently it started working. I'm writing this note because I know this is not the proper solution.
- In the CSS file, there are two background styles commented out, I’m still deciding which one to use.
- Since this project uses only HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript, I opted to use only the default Font Awesome (FAB) icons. But I’ll probably replace them in future updates.
