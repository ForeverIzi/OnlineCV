# Online CV

This is my online CV, created as part of the **Casulo Tecnológico** project, where the goal is to develop something that solves a personal problem using only **HTML and CSS**.

In my case, the problem I decided to tackle is building my online resume, since I've been procrastinating on that for quite a while.

### Note ‼️
- I'm committing from the point where the first section was already done, because i forgot to create the Git repository at the beginning of the project. I only remembered when i was about to start the second section with my professional experience.
